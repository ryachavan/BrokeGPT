# 💸 BrokeGPT – Application of Design Thinking Principles to Finance

BrokeGPT is an interactive **personal finance simulation chatbot** built using **Python and Streamlit**, designed to demonstrate how **Design Thinking principles** can be applied in the financial domain. The project walks through the stages of **Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test**, ultimately resulting in an AI-powered assistant that helps users manage and understand budgeting and spending habits.

---

## 🎯 Objective

This project showcases how human-centered problem-solving can be used to address financial stress through design thinking. The chatbot not only educates users about basic financial concepts but also guides them to make smarter money decisions interactively.

---

## 🧠 Design Thinking Framework

BrokeGPT is structured around the five stages of the Design Thinking process:

1. **Empathize** – Understanding user challenges in managing personal finance.
2. **Define** – Identifying key issues such as poor budgeting, lack of awareness, and emotional spending.
3. **Ideate** – Brainstorming potential tech-driven solutions like financial chatbots.
4. **Prototype** – Developing BrokeGPT using Python and Streamlit.
5. **Test** – Allowing users to interact with BrokeGPT and refine it based on feedback.

🧭 How It Works

The knowledge base (lines 7–1064) forms the chatbot’s intelligence layer, containing curated finance-related insights and responses.

The Streamlit interface captures user input and generates context-based answers.

The system applies design thinking principles to simulate problem-solving for common financial challenges.

🌍 Future Scope

Integrate with real-time financial APIs.

Add machine learning for personalized financial advice.

Enhance visualization using charts and progress trackers.

Deploy using Streamlit Cloud or other hosting platforms.
